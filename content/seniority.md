The engineering community has a lot of trouble talking about _seniority_ and what we consider the "qualifications" for becoming a senior engineer.

It's not uncommon to see folks scoff at the idea that people with under a decade of experience can really be Senior Engineers. After all, how can you _really_ be senior only five years into a
30+ year career?

## Growth Rates are Highly Subjective

People develop the skills required to be senior at drastically different rates.

## Career Levels

Many large engineering organizations have what is called the _career level_ or _terminal level_: the engineering level where you are no longer required to progress to the next level. This is almost always one of the first Senior levels.

People are _supposed_ to be spending a large chunk of their career at a single level.
