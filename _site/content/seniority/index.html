<p>The engineering community has a lot of trouble talking about <em>seniority</em> and what we consider the &quot;qualifications&quot; for becoming a senior engineer.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon to see folks scoff at the idea that people with under a decade of experience can really be Senior Engineers. After all, how can you <em>really</em> be senior only five years into a
30+ year career?</p>
<h2>Growth Rates are Highly Subjective</h2>
<p>People develop the skills required to be senior at drastically different rates.</p>
<h2>Career Levels</h2>
<p>Many large engineering organizations have what is called the <em>career level</em> or <em>terminal level</em>: the engineering level where you are no longer required to progress to the next level. This is almost always one of the first Senior levels.</p>
<p>People are <em>supposed</em> to be spending a large chunk of their career at a single level.</p>
